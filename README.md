<h1><b>PATCH NOTES</b></h1>

<h2><pre>v4.3 The Update to End All Updates<br>     + Director Notes</pre></h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		The team (mostly consists of Modo and me) are now moving onto the presentation part of the project. After that, we will finally break free.
	</li><br>
	<li>
		It is fun to build websites, if only our groupmates aren't dumbfucks who can actually work on a single section of a html, let alone a subpage.
	</li><br>
	<li>
		They just fucking did their individual projects with AI and know no shit about doing actual codes.
	</li><br>
	<li>
		At v4.0, I was trying out the branch feature, It was working splendidly until I tried to merge the branch into main, where it somehow fucked up and corrupted most of my local files.
	</li><br>
	<li>
		Thought the project was done for, good shit I could just rollback the merge and pretend nothing happened.<br>
		Then I recloned everything and it worked well again, only some minor progress were lost.
	</li><br>
	<li>
		Feeling susy about this branch thing, but might try again to see what I did wrong.
	</li><br>
	<li>
		If only I don't have to do every single fucking thing in this project, from <b><br>
		writing the proposal,<br>
		doing the website,<br>
		writing them the script because they know nothing,<br>
		to editing the presentation video.<br>
		</b><br>Then I will probably have had more of a breather.
		<h6>And less fucking stress<br>If you are reading till this point, you can tell my mentals aren't exactly phenomenal</h6>
	</li>
</ul>
<h1><b><pre>Also fucking piece of shit of Charles for taking
Marco away from school when I deliberately asked Marco to
stay to do the presentation.
</pre></b></h1>

<h3>v4.0 contact.html & sermons.html</h3><hr>
<p>Finished contact.html and sermons.html</p>
<p>Added the banner in contact.html and fixed the CSS</p>

<h3>v3.9.2 footer and JavaScript</h3><hr>
<p>Finished footer redesign</p>
<p>Added JavaScript code to the calendar functionality</p>
<p>Added JavaScript code and a PDF file to the duty page</p>
<p>Added an image to the index, events, gallery page</p>
<p>Fixed the text content on the duty page</p>
<p>Fixed the images and text content in the gallery</p>


<h3>v3.9 NavBar v2</h3><hr>
<p>Day following insomnia (wow)</p>
<p>Original Navbar v1 depreciated, moved the HTML & CSS Source codes into components/nav-v1.css</p>
<p>Replaced by Navbar v2 which uses flex and features a sidebar</p>
<p>There is also a cool fancy blur effect when the sidebar is up</p>
<p>Also fixed a little bit spacing of index.html section 5</p>
<p>v.3.9.1 Minor fix - fixed a not covering the li in .nav-flex</p>

<h3>v3.8 Fixing Spacings</h3><hr>
<p>I am currently suffering from insomnia</p>
<p>Fixed most spacings in index to fit for 16:9 screens</p>
<p>Gave 10vw padding to all sections</p>
<p>Footer is now a bit more resillant to resizing</p>

<h3>v3.7 Home Page - Section 5 - Sub Navbar</h3><hr>
<p>Felt weird about having the subtitle to offer help and having no help to offer</p>
<p>So this section 5 is the "help" yknow</p>

<h3>v3.6 gallery.html</h3><hr>
<p>Finished Galery</p>
<p>Fitted JS to when a photo is clicked, a corresponding modal is shown</p>

<h3>v3.4 events.html</h3><hr>
<p>The calendar is officially <b>DONE!</b>, so is the details section 2</p>
<p>Not the JS part of the details ofc</p>
<p>That concludes the events.html probably</p>

<h3>v3.3 index.html</h3><hr>
<p>Finished index.html</p>
<p>Added subpages, and correctly linked them in the navbar</p>

<h3>v3.2</h3><hr>
<p>Stole some css animations from here and there, mostly from UIverse</p>
<p>UIverse is <b>GOATED</b></p>
<p>This includes the Facebook button, Scrollspy (not Bootstrap), and cards</p>

<h3>v3.0</h3><hr>
<p>Implemented Bootstrap into the project, thus requiring this rebuild</p>
