<p>Someone write the fucking readme.md<br>The patch notes especially</p>

<h2>PATCH NOTES</h2>

<h3>v3.9 NavBar v2</h3>
<p>Day following insomnia (wow)</p>
<p>Original Navbar v1 depreciated, moved the HTML & CSS Source codes into components/nav-v1.css</p>
<p>Replaced by Navbar v2 which uses flex and features a sidebar</p>
<p>There is also a cool fancy blur effect when the sidebar is up</p>
<p>Also fixed a little bit spacing of index.html section 5</p>
<p>v.3.9.1 Minor fix - fixed a not covering the li in .nav-flex</p>

<h3>v3.8 Fixing Spacings</h3>
<p>I am currently suffering from insomnia</p>
<p>Fixed most spacings in index to fit for 16:9 screens</p>
<p>Gave 10vw padding to all sections</p>
<p>Footer is now a bit more resillant to resizing</p>

<h3>v3.7 Home Page - Section 5 - Sub Navbar</h3>
<p>Felt weird about having the subtitle to offer help and having no help to offer</p>
<p>So this section 5 is the "help" yknow</p>

<h3>v3.6 gallery.html</h3>
<p>Finished Galery</p>
<p>Fitted JS to when a photo is clicked, a corresponding modal is shown</p>

<h3>v3.4 events.html</h3>
<p>The calendar is officially <b>DONE!</b>, so is the details section 2</p>
<p>Not the JS part of the details ofc</p>
<p>That concludes the events.html probably</p>

<h3>v3.3 index.html</h3>
<p>Finished index.html</p>
<p>Added subpages, and correctly linked them in the navbar</p>

<h3>v3.2</h3>
<p>Stole some css animations from here and there, mostly from UIverse</p>
<p>UIverse is <b>GOATED</b></p>
<p>This includes the Facebook button, Scrollspy (not Bootstrap), and cards</p>

<h3>v3.0</h3>
<p>Implemented Bootstrap into the project, thus requiring this rebuild</p>
